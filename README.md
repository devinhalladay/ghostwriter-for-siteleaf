# Ghostwriter for Siteleaf

A simple AJAX-driven theme for [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com) ported from [@roryg's theme](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter) by [Devin Halladay](http://devinhalladay.com).

To use it, just [download the theme zip](https://github.com/devinhalladay/ghostwriter-for-siteleaf/archive/master.zip) and upload it to your [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) site. Create a page for the body content (I used /blog). Then, add the following site meta field(s):
